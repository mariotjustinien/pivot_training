# Training

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.2.

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to learn angular. Each developer has at least one component
to develop. To begin with, each component will be developed  separately. Then, a
homepage page will be designed to contain a navigation bar and allow the navigation between the 3 components.

##### List of components :

- **Todo list** : a task written in the input form should appear in the list below that form when the user clicks on the button 'add'. Each item on the list should be removed when clicking on an icon 'cross'.
    - Improvement 1 : add an edition functionality.


- **Youtube player** : an input form takes a youtube video url as entry and shows the youtube video inside a div below the form. Additionally, each request should create an entry in a local history list shown on the left side of the page.
    - Improvement 1 : if an item of the history is clicked, the related video should be shown


- **Calculator** : the Calculator is represented by a table of buttons. Each button represents a digit or an operation. A readonly input form will show the input progression and the result when the button '=' is pushed. We expect a simple Calculator able to compute the basic operations : +,-,/,* .
    - Improvement 1 : Add the 'Ans' functionality. If there's a result in the input form, pushing on an operation button (+,-,/,* ) will start a new computation using the last ANSwer as first operand.

##### Project expected structure

/App
- /Components
    - /TodoList
    - /YoutubePlayer
    - /Calculator
- /Pages
    - /TodoListPage
    - /YoutubePlayerPage
    - /CalculatorPage
- app.components.html
- app.components.ts
- app.module.ts
- app.routing.ts

##### First task

- Create components for each page
- modify the rooting file to use them
- start developing your own page and components

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
